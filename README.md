# Ethereum-Smart-Contracts

This code pertains to some ethereum smart contracts for energy prosumers that I programmed in solidity using the Remix IDE. 
The comments present in the code describe through the various functional elements in detail, helping the reader understand the exact processes being executed. 

If you wish to play around with it, copy and paste the source code in the Remix IDE which can be found here: https://remix.ethereum.org 
A guide to using the Remix IDE is found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06oTox9LSlU&ab_channel=QuillAcademy
